Software design is an iterative process involving identifying a problem, considering potential solutions, planning their implementation,
and then following through with that implementation. Over the duration of the course, I learned how to shape, texture, position, and light
objects in a 3D environment. My design strategy typically revolved around grouping steps based on similarity rather than repeat the
entire design process for each object. In other words, I focused on getting every object shaped and positioned correctly, then applied
textures, and finally implemented materials and lighting for the scene. This approach also allowed me to address similar issues in tandem
without needing a debug period for individual objects.

Initially, my code development was looser than I'd have liked, so I began developing more static conventions with an emphasis on strict functionality.
I also found that commenting for even minute details helped to draw a clearer picture of each version of the code, enabling me to work faster
as I didn't need to remember exactly what I'd done prior.

The ability to engage in object design is a valuable skillset that will allow me to go beyond the backend portion of coding. I've already begun
modeling objects as a side-hobby to learn more about things like texturing and the design process.
